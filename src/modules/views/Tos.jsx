The Platform is intended only for access and use by individuals at least thirteen (13) years old. By downloading, accessing, or using any part of the Platform, you warrant and represent that you are at least thirteen (13) years old, with the full authority, right, and capacity to enter into these Terms and abide by all of the terms and conditions of these Terms. If you are under the age of eighteen (18), by downloading, accessing, or using any part of the Platform, you further warrant and represent that you have obtained fully authorized consent of a parent or legal guardian prior to your download, access, or use of the Platform.

Changes to the Terms of Use

We may revise and update these Terms from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we post them, and apply to all access to and use of the Platform thereafter. Your continued use of the Platform or our Services following the posting of revised Terms means you accept and agree to the changes, as they are binding on you.

If you download the Company’s mobile application, you agree and understand that the mobile application and all related products and software (collectively, the “Application”) are licensed, not sold, to you for use only under these Terms of Use. The Company reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.

This license granted to you for the Application by the Company is limited to a non-transferable license to use the Application on any device that you own or control and as permitted by these Terms of Use and any other terms that may apply when you download the Application.

Any attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of the Company and its licensors. If you breach this restriction, you may be subject to prosecution and damages. The terms of the license will govern any upgrades provided by the Company that replace and/or supplement the original Application, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.

This license is in addition to any license terms required by Apple or any other source from which you may download the Application, and all are binding on you. In the event that this license conflicts with other license terms, these terms control.
