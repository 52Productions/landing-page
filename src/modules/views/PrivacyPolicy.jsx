        PRIVACY POLICY
Introduction  

52Productions Inc. (“Company,” “our,” “we”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. This Privacy Policy is part of our Terms of Use available [here]. 

This policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you download, install, register with, access, or use our mobile game application, “Batty” (the “Platform”) and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.
 
This policy applies to information we, and not third parties, collect:
 
In the Platform.
In email, text, or other electronic communication sent through or in connection with the Platform.
Through mobile resources you download from the Platform.
When you interact with our advertising and Platform on third-party applications and services, if those services or advertising include links to this policy.

It does not apply to information collected by the Company offline or on any other Company application, platform, or website or any third party, including through any application or content that may link to or be accessible from the Platform.
Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, do not download, register with, or use the Platform. By downloading, registering with, accessing, or using the Platform, you are agreeing that you understand and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. This policy may change from time to time, as described below. Your continued use of the Platform after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy frequently for updates.
 
Children Under the Age of 13  

The Platform is not intended for children under 13 years of age. No one under age 13 may provide any information to or on the Platform. We do not knowingly collect information of any sort, including personal information, from children under 13. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any information on the Platform. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us immediately at info@52productions.

Information We Collect About You and How We Collect It  

We collect several types of information from and about users of the Platform, including information:
 
by which you may be personally identified, such as name and e-mail address (“personal information”);
that you voluntarily enter, such as name and email address; 
that you provide when you use the Platform, such as name, email address, and generated ID and device ID created through PlayFab; and 
about your internet connection, the equipment you use to access the Platform, and usage details.

We collect this information directly from you when you provide it to us through your use of the Platform and/or when you sign up for an account while using Google (to link your Google account to the Platform).
The information we collect is used by us to provide users with services, support, sales and marketing action, and to meet contractual obligations.

How We Use Your Information  

We use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any personal information:
 
To present the Platform and its contents to you.
To provide you with information, products, or services that you request from us.
To fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it.
To carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including for billing and collection.
To notify you about changes to the Platform or any products or services we offer or provide though it.
In any other way we may describe when you provide the information.
For any other purpose with your consent.  

Disclosure of Your Information  

We may disclose aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual, without restriction.
 
We may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide:
 
To our subsidiaries and affiliates.
To contractors, service providers, and other third parties we use to support our business. For example, we use services including but not limited to Google Authentication, PlayFab, Google Speech, and Microsoft Azure in order to support the Platform. As such, we may disclose your personal information to these third parties in support of our business. 
To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by us about the Platform users is among the assets transferred.
To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it. For example, if you provide a Google account log-in information in order to store you score, we will store your Google account log-in information for this purpose.
For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.
With your consent. 
To comply with any court order, law, or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request.
If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our customers, or others.

Data Retention
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. 

Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information


We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:
Tracking Technologies. You can choose whether or not to allow the Platform to collect information through other tracking technologies by selecting this option when made available to you. If you disable or refuse cookies or block the use of other tracking technologies, some parts of the Platform may then be inaccessible or not function properly.
Location Information. You can choose whether or not to allow the Platform to collect and use real-time information about your device's location through the device's privacy settings. 

Accessing and Correcting Your Information  

You may send us an email at info@52.productions to request access to, correct, or delete any personal information that you have provided to us. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. 
 
Your California Privacy Rights  

California Civil Code Section § 1798.83 permits users of the Platform that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to info@52.productions. 
 
Transferring your information

By using the Platform, you authorize us to transfer and store your information outside your home country, including in the United States, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. The privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your information in these countries may not be the same as in your home country.

Data Security  

We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. The information we collect is encrypted through the Platform with Secure Socket Layer technology (SSL) and is also encrypted when it is stored by us to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via your mobile device, the internet, or digital means is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to the Platform. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Platform.

Changes to Our Privacy Policy  

It is our policy to post any changes we make to our privacy policy. If we make material changes to how we treat our users’ personal information, we will notify you through a notice on the Platform the first time you use the Platform after we make the change and/or an email to the most recent email address that you provided to us, if any. If you have provided your Google log-in information or email address, you are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date active and deliverable email address for you, and for frequently visiting the Platform and this Privacy Policy to check for any changes.
